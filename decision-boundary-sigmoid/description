these implement the sigmoid function and decision boundary optimiaztion algorithms in MATLAB. 
this was done through the Machine learning course online with Stanford and Dr. Andrew Ng.
Some of the peripheral and testing files were provided by the course, but the actual algorithms were implemented by me.
